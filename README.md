# Missing Asset

**To show trees you will need to add a prefab to your unity project with a tree**. The ref to that asset should be given to the `Forest` class. Because i am using one that's not free I cannot add it to this repository. for the screenshots I am using Tree6.006 [from here](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vegetation/trees/low-poly-trees-seasons-67486).

Some of the stuff here comes from other devs:

* The Perlin noise implementation [comes from here](https://github.com/SebLague/Procedural-Landmass-Generation). Thanks again Sebastian :)
* The Water shader [comes from here](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/lowpoly-water-107563#description). It's free!
* The Triangulator class comes from a unity wiki post that [no longer exists](http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php?title=Triangulator).
